Indian food has always been a huge part of my diet growing up and since going lowcarb, gluten free, sugar free etc that hasn't changed.  I've always been a huuuge fan of Chicken Tikka, normally marinating mine in Greek Yogurt, but recently I've decided to cut out dairy from my diet, as part of an elimination type diet I'm on atm, meaning I've had to find some dairy free alternatives for my favourite foods and as it turns out - Coconut Milk is a fantastic substitute for Greek Yogurt in this case! 👌

If dairy is part of your diet though then by all means use Greek Yogurt but either way be warned - you're gonna end up with some bad ass Chicken Tikka you'll have a hard time convincing people you actually made yourself, it tastes that good!! 😄
And of course like everything I cook, the ingredients list is short, the cooking process is easy & the results are immense!!  So without further ado.. Enjoy! 😄🙌

Instructions
</h5>
1. Put all the ingredients (except the chicken) into a blender and blend to make the marinade.  (About 15 seconds on a NutriBullet)  If you don't have a blender whipping in a bowl also works 👌
2. Put the chicken in a bowl or dish & entirely cover with the marinade.
3. Place in the fridge for at least 6 hours.
4. After 6 hours, line a baking tray with foil & lightly apply some oil to stop the chicken sticking.
5. Place the chicken pieces on the tray, evenly spaced.  (You can also put them on skewers if you want instead of on a tray)
6. Put under the grill on medium heat until the top starts to slightly brown (takes about 10 min on my grill).
7. Turn the chicken pieces over & grill until cooked (cut one open once they're sufficiently brown to make sure they're no longer pink inside).
8. Enjoy 😁
