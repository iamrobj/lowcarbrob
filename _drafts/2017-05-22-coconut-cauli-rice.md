Indian food has always been a huge part of my diet growing up and since going lowcarb, gluten free, sugar free etc that hasn't changed.  I've always been a huuuge fan of Chicken Tikka, normally marinating mine in Greek Yogurt, but recently I've decided to cut out dairy from my diet, as part of an elimination type diet I'm on atm, meaning I've had to find some dairy free alternatives for my favourite foods and as it turns out - Coconut Milk is a fantastic substitute for Greek Yogurt in this case! üëå

If dairy is part of your diet though then by all means use Greek Yogurt but either way be warned - you're gonna end up with some bad ass Chicken Tikka you'll have a hard time convincing people you actually made yourself, it tastes that good!! üòÑ
And of course like everything I cook, the ingredients list is short, the cooking process is easy & the results are immense!!  So without further ado.. Enjoy! üòÑüôå

Instructions
</h5>
1. Cut all the florets off the caulfilower, you want as little stalk as possible.
2. Put the florets into a blender & blend until you have fine rice sized pieces.  (tip: blending the florets in batches is much easier than trying to do the whole lot at once)
3. Now you want to drain as much water from the cauliflower as possible.  I use a nut milk bag to do this, but if you don't have one you can easily wrap the cauliflower in a tea towel and wring all the water out.
4. Finely chop the garlic & lemongrass.
5. Put a tablespoon of coconut oil in a pot on medium heat.
6. Throw in the chopped garlic & lemon grass.
7. After a minute throw in the cauliflower & stir.
8. Cook for about 10 mins or until it starts to brown, stir every minute or so.
9. Add the coconut milk, stir well.
10. Leave on a low height for another 5 mins or so, until the mix starts to dry out a bit.
11. And you're done!  Enjoy üòÅ
