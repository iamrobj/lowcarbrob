######Instructions
</div>
>1. Melt the butter, half of the dark chocolate & coconut oil.  (I usually do this in the microwave, about 1 min on high should do it.)
2. Mix the melted ingredients along with the coconut milk & peppermint extract until completely mixed together.
3. Add in all the dry ingredients **except** the remaining dark chocolate & cacao nibs.  Mix until well combined.
4. Leave for a minute so the coconut flour can soak up some of the wet ingredients.
5. Add the cacao nibs & the remaining dark chococlate, mix well.
6. Line a baking tray with baking paper.  Spray with a little oil. (I use coconut oil.)
7. Wet your hands a little, take a handful of the mixture & roll into a ball.  Place on the tray.  This mix should make about 6 cookies.  Wet your hands for each ball to prevent the mix from sticking to your hands.
8. Using a fork, roughly flatten the balls into cookie shapes.  I've found the key to making sure they're not too crumbly (as we're not using eggs to stick them together) is to keep them about a half inch thick.
9. Put the tray into the oven at 160C/320F.
10. Cook for about 10 mins or until they're starting to firm up.
11. Take them out of the oven, let them cool down.
12. Enjoy!
