I've been meaning to do a weekly round up of the best low carb recipes I've found for a while now.. I have no viable excuse why it's taken this long for me to do it.  I'm just gonna take it as a win you're now reading this which means I've finally done one üòÄ

I'll say upfront, I may not have cooked any of these recipes... Yet.  My "to-cook" list is a mile long with all the great recipes people in the community are sharing everyday, however if a recipe is featured here you can be sure it's on my list!  Also you can be sure it's low carb & that the ingredient list is something I'd use.  (Sorry to the people who think 1 cup of almond flour in pancakes is ok - none of that here :see_no_evil:)

So without further ado - here's the best low carb recipes I've discovered this week!  Feel free to point out any I might've missed in the comments :)

####Best low carb recipes this week
* Having recently bought a XX I can't wait to give this  [Strawberry Coconut Flour Mug Cake](http://lowcarbyum.com/strawberry-coconut-flour-mug-cake-paleo/) recipe from [@lowcarbyum](https://twitter.com/lowcarbyum) a go!  (I know it clearly says mug cake - but I like to be different üòÖ)
* [Bacon wrapped Chicken Tenders](http://lowcarbyum.com/oven-baked-bacon-wrapped-chicken-tenders/) - The title says bacon.  'Nuff said.
* Now this [Chocolate Avocado ice cream](http://sugarfreelondoner.com/low-carb-chocolate-avocado-ice-cream/) is defintely on my to-do list!!  I've been looking for a decent low carb ice cream recipe for so long and finallly this looks like it could be the ticket üëå
* [Supreme Cheese Pizza Rolls](http://www.wickedstuffed.com/keto-recipes/supreme-cheese-pizza-rolls-keto-low-carb/)  Two words.  Yes...  Yes.
* I found these [Mini Pepper Nachos](https://asweetlife.org/mini-pepper-nachos/) found via [Carolyn's](http://twitter.com/dreamaboutfood) low carb game day  [round up post](http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2017/02/the-best-low-carb-game-day-recipes.html via http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2017/02/the-best-low-carb-game-day-recipes.html) & there is no way this is not going to be made one evening this week.  In fact, I can imagine these becoming a leftover staple for me üòè   (leftover as in cook wayy too much, eat wayy to much, eat the rest tomorrow üòÖ)
