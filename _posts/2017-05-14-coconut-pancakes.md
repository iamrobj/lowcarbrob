You have noooo idea how much I missed cooking after being away in Bali, Indonesia for 2.5 months!!  The first thing I did when I got back was whip up a huge salad.. then lamb chops.. the next day I cooked my entire family dinner consisting of Thai Green Curry, Vegetable Madras, Dairy free Chicken Tikka & Lamb seekh kebabs 😁 .. And then yesterday after months of no pancakes I finalllly whipped up a batch of these bad boys for my post workout meal 💪

If you follow me on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/lowcarbrob){:target="_blank"} you'll know I make a tonnnn of pancakes & soo many people have asked me how I make my fluffy coconut ones, I always throw the recipe into the comments but I thought I'd make it official with a post you can bookmark next time you get the pancake craving 😁

And of course like everything I cook, the ingredients list is short, the cooking process is easy & the results are sooo gooooood 😋😋   Enjoy! 😄🙌

Instructions
</h5>
1. Put all the ingredients into a blender and blend until you have a nice batter.  (About 15 seconds on a NutriBullet)  If you don't have a blender whipping in a bowl also works 👌
2. Put a frying pan on medium heat & spray with a little oil of your choice. (I use coconut oil)
3. Pour in some of the batter.
4. Let it cook until the edges of the pancake start to show lots of little air bubbles.
5. At this point it's usually safe to flip the pancake.
6. Cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.
7. Remove the pancake from the pan & repeat until you've used all the batter.
8. That's it - simple.  Nnow go eat 😁
