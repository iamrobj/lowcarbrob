One more sporadic recipe to add to the collection ðŸ˜…  I realise this is the first recipe I've posted in 2 months, the second in 5 months ðŸ™ˆ    and I understand the key to being a successful blogger is consistency.  But I also understand that this is fun for me and I'd like to think my posts provide fun for you (moreso in the kitchen than in the content ðŸ˜„) so while I should probably post more you should know if I post something I created here - it must've been damn good! ðŸ˜¬    
That being said I recently moved my site from a self hosted Wordpress to [Jekyll via GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} (in case that last sentence doesn't convey it - I'm a little bit of a geek ðŸ¤“) & am genuinely so excited with the new setup I imagine they'll be alot more posts coming just because I enjoy tinkering with it so much!  And now, onto the recipe..

At the tail end of last year I had a friend who was recommended to cut out dairy - which pretty much took 90% of the desserts I could share with her off the table.  So I took [my fave cookie recipe](http://sugarfreelondoner.com/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies-low-carb/){:target="_blank"} at the time (from [@SugarFreeLondon](https://twitter.com/Sugarfreelondon){:target="_blank"}) & substituted the cream for coconut milk & voila!  Dairy free cookies!  To be fair, they came out more cakey than cookie but either way - whose complaining ðŸ˜‰   Recently however, another friend of mine found out she has an allergy to eggs which got me thinking.. How could I live without eggs?  ðŸ¤”

So I decided to freestyle a cookie recipe, based on the ingredients I had at the time, and as I'm currently pursuing ketosis I added a few ingredients to bump up the fat content and I must say..  The first batch were goooooood!!  Who needs eggs right!  Well, as it turns out, cookies do.. Without eggs things get pretty crumbly pretty quick, and no one want to eat a cookie with a spoon ðŸ˜›  So I took another stab at it, this time adding in flax seed for a bit of a stickier texture (thanks for the tip, you know who you are!) & making the cookies a little thicker than usual & voila!  Eggless Mint Chocolate Chip Cookies that don't crumble when you pick them up!  The mint actually came as a nice little surprise to me as I totally forgot I'd dropped a little bit of peppermint extract in there ðŸ˜….

Of course the real test for any low carb, keto friendly, sugar free, dairy free, egg free desserts (what a mouthful!) is... the muggle test.  A term I think I may have just invented - referring of course to those we know that survive on, let's say, a less than "healthy" diet.  And it passed!!  Actually with flying colors!

Alot of the time the dessert type recipes I cook are often a comprimise.  They always taste good.. for low carb.. or for gluten free.. or for keto friendly.. etc.. etc..  These however.. these, taste good.  Period.  ðŸ˜Ž

Enjoy!

* Coconut oil 20g

######Instructions
</div>
>1. Melt the butter, half of the dark chocolate & coconut oil.  (I usually do this in the microwave, about 1 min on high should do it.)
2. Mix the melted ingredients along with the coconut milk & peppermint extract until completely mixed together.
3. Add in all the dry ingredients **except** the remaining dark chocolate & cacao nibs.  Mix until well combined.
4. Leave for a minute so the coconut flour can soak up some of the wet ingredients.
5. Add the cacao nibs & the remaining dark chococlate, mix well.
6. Line a baking tray with baking paper.  Spray with a little oil. (I use coconut oil.)
7. Wet your hands a little, take a handful of the mixture & roll into a ball.  Place on the tray.  This mix should make about 6 cookies.  Wet your hands for each ball to prevent the mix from sticking to your hands.
8. Using a fork, roughly flatten the balls into cookie shapes.  I've found the key to making sure they're not too crumbly (as we're not using eggs to stick them together) is to keep them about a half inch thick.
9. Put the tray into the oven at 160C/320F.
10. Cook for about 10 mins or until they're starting to firm up.
11. Take them out of the oven, let them cool down.
12. Enjoy!
