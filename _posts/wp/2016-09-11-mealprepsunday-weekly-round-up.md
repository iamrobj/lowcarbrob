Sunday in my kitchen has officially become meal prep day, as it no doubt has in a lot of your kitchens too. &nbsp;Today I&#8217;ve prepped 15 buffalo chicken wings, 12 boiled eggs, 10 chocolate chip cookies, 10 cinnamon balls, and toasted shredded coconut &#8211; all before 11am ðŸ˜€ &nbsp;Oh, and that is all just for this weeks lunches ðŸ˜€ &nbsp;(I enjoy&nbsp;cooking dinner fresh)

It really does make life so much easier. &nbsp;

The inspiration to start doing the weeks lunches in advance came, in large part, from various people on Instagram I follow who do the same which got me thinking about things I see or read or listen to which others may not. &nbsp;So I&#8217;ve had the&nbsp;idea for this weekly post in my head for a while now, I read a lot during the week (new recipes, posts on nutrition, fitness, health etc) as well as listen to (ALOT) of podcasts so I though it&#8217;d be cool to do a weekly round up of the things&nbsp;I found the most interesting, both for you to browse through and hopefully find some value in, and for me to have a record of ðŸ™‚

So here goes &#8211; I&#8217;ve kept it fairly concise this week but going forward I plan on being alot more comprehensive on the things I&#8217;ve found ðŸ™‚&nbsp; Oh,&nbsp;and if you find anything here useful/informative/beneficial&nbsp;it would be AWESOME if you could drop me a comment and let me know ðŸ˜€

Enjoy!

## Recipes:

  * [@Sugarfree_Londoner](https://www.instagram.com/sugarfree_londoner/)&#8216;s [Ultimate Chocolate chip cookies](http://sugarfreelondoner.com/ultimate-chocolate-chip-cookies-low-carb/) are low carb, gluten free & obviously, sugar free!! &nbsp;I had a go at making these bad boys this week and I have to confess, I&#8217;m a little bit addicted.. I made my third batch in 4 days this morning.. I know, I have a problem. &nbsp;But they&#8217;re just so damn tasty!

## Health & Fitness:

  * [@RyanMunsey](https://twitter.com/ryanmunsey) shares [10 secrets of the supplement industry](https://www.naturalstacks.com/blogs/news/116617093-the-supplement-industrys-top-10-hidden-secrets/) &#8211; definitely makes you think twice next time you look at the label of some new hot supplement.
  * [@BenGreenfield](https://twitter.com/bengreenfield) explains [why it&#8217;s a myth that you only have a a 30 minute window](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2011/10/post-workout-nutrition/) after working out to eat for the best muscle recovery. &nbsp;I personally searched this one out as I&#8217;ve been experimenting with a late workout after my eating window has closed, thankfully it turns out&nbsp;the 30 minute window is&nbsp;more &#8220;Bro Science&#8221; than actual science.
