I've been meaning to do a weekly round up of the best low carb recipes I've found each week for a while now.. I have no viable excuse why it's taken this long for me to do it. 🙈  I'm just gonna take it as a win you're now reading this now which means I've finally done one 😀

I'll say upfront, I _may_ not have cooked any of these recipes... Yet.  My "to-cook" list is a mile long with all the great recipes people in the community are sharing everyday, however, if a recipe is featured here you can be sure it's on my to-cook list!  Also you can be sure it's low carb & that the ingredient list is something I'd use.  (Sorry to the people who think 1 cup of almond flour in pancakes is ok - none of that here 🙈)

So without further ado - here's the best low carb recipes I've discovered this past week!  Feel free to point out any I might've missed in the comments :)

#### Best low carb recipes this week
* Having recently bought a ramekin dish I cannot wait to give this  [Strawberry Coconut Flour Mug Cake](http://lowcarbyum.com/strawberry-coconut-flour-mug-cake-paleo/){:target="_blank"} recipe from [@lowcarbyum](https://twitter.com/lowcarbyum){:target="_blank"} a go!  (I know it clearly says _mug_ cake - but I like to be different 😅)
* [Bacon wrapped Chicken Tenders](http://lowcarbyum.com/oven-baked-bacon-wrapped-chicken-tenders/){:target="_blank"} - The title says bacon.  'Nuff said.
* Now these [1 minute keto muffins](http://www.ditchthecarbs.com/2017/01/25/1-minute-keto-muffins/){:target="_blank"} from [@ditchthe_carbs](https://twitter.com/ditchthe_carbs){:target="_blank"} I actually made.  Super easy to make, tons of things you an do with them.  I went for a savoury & a sweet.  My DIY parmesean & basil experiment definitely needs work 😂  but the cinnamon one I made was goooood!
* This [Chocolate Avocado ice cream](http://sugarfreelondoner.com/low-carb-chocolate-avocado-ice-cream/){:target="_blank"} from [@Sugarfreelondon](https://twitter.com/Sugarfreelondon){:target="_blank"} is defintely on my to-do list!!  I've been looking for a decent low carb ice cream recipe for so long and finallly this looks like it could be the ticket 👌
* [Supreme Cheese Pizza Rolls](http://www.wickedstuffed.com/keto-recipes/supreme-cheese-pizza-rolls-keto-low-carb/){:target="_blank"} from [@wickedstuffed](https://twitter.com/wickedstuffed){:target="_blank"}  Two words.  Yes...  Yes.
* I found these [Mini Pepper Nachos](https://asweetlife.org/mini-pepper-nachos/) by [@A_Sweet_Life](https://twitter.com/A_Sweet_Life){:target="_blank"} {found via [Carolyn's](http://twitter.com/dreamaboutfood){:target="_blank"} low carb game day  [round up post](http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2017/02/the-best-low-carb-game-day-recipes.html via http://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/2017/02/the-best-low-carb-game-day-recipes.html){:target="_blank"} & there is no way this is not going to be made one evening this week.  In fact, I can imagine these becoming a leftover staple for me 😏   (leftover as in cook wayy too much, eat wayy to much, eat the rest tomorrow 😅)
