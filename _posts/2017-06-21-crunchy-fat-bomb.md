I've always been intrigured by the concept of fat bombs, mostly from the standpoint that ALOT of the recipes I see for them are more like dessert replacements as opposed to just snacks.  Don't get me wrong, I love healthy low carb fat bomb dessert replacements like keto almond butter cups or coconut "bounty" bars, but sometimes I just want a snack & a handful of nuts doesn't always satisfy my tastebuds, not too mention the nutritional profile of a handful or nuts isn't close the nutrional profile of something like this, it isn't purely about grams of fat for me.

So the other night I figured why not try and make a savoury fat bomb, something that would be a good snack food, nutrionally dense AND high in a variety of healthy fats.  Alongside one other caveat being I wanted something with a crunch to it, kind've like a traditional snack bar but without all the crap.  And so, I tossed in every crunchy high fat ingredient I had on hand into a bowl, glued it together with coconut oil and ended up with these bad boys! üòéüòé

And of course like everything I cook, the ingredients list is short, in this case there's zero cooking involved & the results are tooootally worthwhile!!  So without further ado.. Enjoy! üòÑüôå
