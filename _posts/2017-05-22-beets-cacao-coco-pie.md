One of my favourite things about living in Ubud, Bali for a couple of months this year was, of course, the food.  If you care about eating organic, gluten free, processed sugar free, dairy free, vegan or any other form of "free from" then Ubud is literally your foodie paradise 😍   And one of my faaaavourite desserts I came across over there was a raw Beetroo Cacao Coconut pie!  So of course when I had a craving for something a little bit sweet the other day I figured I'd try my hand at making one 🤓🤓

Now this isn't anywhere near identical to the one I was devouring out there, in fact this is pretty different in texture and look anddd taste.  However, this little experimental number came out tasting AMAZING and so of course I had to share...

Not only does it taste great but it's completely raw, dairy free, egg free, gluten free, sugar free & even sweetener free! 😄  The only sweetness comes from the medium banana I threw in (mainly for texture), so you can grab yourself a decent sized slight with zero guilt - it's all natural!

And of course like everything I cook, the ingredients list is short, in this case there's zero cooking required & the results are immense!!  So without further ado.. Enjoy! 😄🙌
